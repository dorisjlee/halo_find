Question about ml_halo project

0 What is the danger of nearby haloes "linking bridges"? Is it because it obscures the identification of subhaloes ?
- What does it mean when a halo finding algorithm doesn't support "multiple particle masses"(e.g. Rockstar)
- 6D phase space ---> what does that mean? what are the variables here? 
- don't quite understand what the significance of the Vmax selection criterion is
-  softenings of the runs are as follows:
0256	50 kpc/h
0512	25 kpc/h
1024	15 kpc/h
	What does that mean?
